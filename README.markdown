## Local Code ##

- - -

This is a repository of scripts being used on the [Local Code Project](http://nicholas.demonchaux.com) which is currently in residency at the [Autodesk Idea Studio](http://usa.autodesk.com/ideastudio).
These scripts are new, messy, and in development. Feel free to browse them, but don't expect them to work well or safely on your computer.  

####So far the scripts include:  
- shpPopulate.py: used for loading a large quantity of shapefiles into a PostGIS/PostgreSQL database.
- db.py: some scripts for running queries and retrieving gis data
- sql.py: scripts for composing specific sql queries.
- mayascripts.py: a set of functions used in Autodesk Maya to retrieve and render animations of gis data based on SQL queries
